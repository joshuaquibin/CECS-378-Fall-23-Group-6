# BLE Advertising Process

# In BLE, devices can broadcast packets to advertise their presence, service capabilities, or other data. These packets are not directed to a specific device but are intended to be read by any scanning device in the vicinity. This is called advertising.

# BLE advertising packets have different PDU (Protocol Data Unit) types, which define the purpose and structure of the packet. Common types include:

#     ADV_IND: Connectable undirected advertising (PDU type 0x00)
#     ADV_DIRECT_IND: Connectable directed advertising (PDU type 0x01)
#     ADV_NONCONN_IND: Non-connectable undirected advertising (PDU type 0x02)
#     ADV_SCAN_IND: Scannable undirected advertising (PDU type 0x06)

# Tshark Display Filters

# Tshark uses display filters to determine which packets to show or hide. These filters are based on the fields of the packet and can be combined using logical operators. For instance:

#     == is used for comparison (equality).
#     ! negates a condition.
#     || stands for logical OR.

# The Filter Construction

# When creating the filter !(btle.advertising_header.pdu_type == 0x00), we're asking tshark to exclude packets (! negates the condition) where the BLE advertising header's PDU type is equal to 0x00 (ADV_IND packets). However, we also want to exclude other types of advertising packets (e.g., ADV_NONCONN_IND, ADV_SCAN_IND).

# To do this, we extend the filter with additional PDU types using logical OR ||. The filter "!(btle.advertising_header.pdu_type == 0x00 || btle.advertising_header.pdu_type == 0x02 || btle.advertising_header.pdu_type == 0x04 || btle.advertising_header.pdu_type == 0x06)" now excludes all the common advertising PDU types.
