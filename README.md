## Set Up "Bluefruit LE Sniffer - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE 4.0) - nRF51822" to computer

First, make sure you have Wireshark installed on your Windows machine(This setup doesn't work on Windows VM's)

<h4><strong>Set Up Step by Step instruction with images</strong></h4>
<h6>all this steps where gotten from the Adafruit website instructions: https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-the-adafruit-bluefruit-le-sniffer/using-with-sniffer-v2-and-python3</h6>

1.Go to this website "https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads" and Download the "CP210x Universal Windows Driver".

2. Go to the folder where the zip was downloaded and extract the zip there or whatever location you want. After extracting right-click the extracted folder and copy the path of the folder, you will need it.

3. After copying the folder path, go to Device Manager and you should see that the USB needs to install the necessary drivers.

4. Right-click the displayed name, in this case for me is the one named "CP2102N USB to UART Bridge Controller" and go to properties.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ram6Vhw.png" alt="MLH-banner" width="50%" height="50%">

5. Then, in properties click on "Update Driver.." and select the option "Browse my computer for drivers". There in the field "Search for drivers in this location", paste the path you copied from the extracted folder and click Next. You Successfully updated the Drivers! ðŸ‘»ðŸ¥³ðŸ™Œ

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zdaoxAr.png" alt="MLH-banner" width="50%" height="50%">

6. You will notice that the "Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge(COM3)" will be in the "Ports (COM & LPT)"

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/w4ZNhrX.png" alt="MLH-banner" width="50%" height="50%">

7. Now, install Python on your computer, in this case, I download it in the Microsoft Store.
   After downloading it, open a new command prompt and use command:
   ```bash
   python3
   ```
   it will show just like the second picture.
   You will notice that it will not let us "import serial"
   Therefore, we will need to install it:
   First, exit the python command line using command:
   ```bash
   exit()
   ```
   Then to install, use command:
   ```bash
   pip install pyserial
   ```
   If we enter the Python command line interface now we are going to be able to import serial.

<h4>If you still cant import serial, just like what just happened to me in the previous step ðŸ˜…</h4>
Then, you might need to install pyserial directly where your python is installed.
in my cose I would solve it using this command:
format is: python_executable -m pip install pyserial
In my case:

```bash
C:\Users\brill\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.11_qbz5n2kfra8p0\python.exe -m pip install pyserial
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0KrUaOC.png" alt="MLH-banner" width="50%" height="50%">

8. Go to this link: "https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Sniffer-for-Bluetooth-LE/Download?lang=en#infotabs" and download the "nrf_sniffer_for_bluetooth_le_4.1.1.zip" and go to the folder you download it and extract all the zip.
   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LdSeq8u.png" alt="MLH-banner" width="50%" height="50%">

9. Now open the folder you extracted and go to the folder that is inside that is called "extcap". Inside the "extcap" folder, you will see a "nrf_sniffer_ble" that is a batch script. We will run this in some second in the command prompt.
   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/67cvIcz.png" alt="MLH-banner" width="50%" height="50%">
   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/4r3SIxO.png" alt="MLH-banner" width="50%" height="50%">

10. Right-click inside the "extcap" folder where we found the "nrf_sniffer_ble" and in the path where it says in my case "Downloads > nrf_sniffer_for_bluetooth_le_4.1.1 > extcap" replace tha path and just write "cmd" and press Enter key (This will redirect you to the command prompt inside that folder, you can use whatever method you want to go inside that folder)
    In that command prompt inside the "extcap" folder, we would use this command in order to execute that batch file "nrf_sniffer_ble" that we found on that folder:

    ```bash
    nrf_sniffer_ble.bat
    ```

    It will tell you to run a command in order to install the necessary things, in my case they want me to do this command but it will vary for you:

    ```bash
    C:\Users\brill\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.11_qbz5n2kfra8p0\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/5GLWDMz.png" alt="MLH-banner" width="50%" height="50%">

    <strong>The command will install the necessary import in order for wireshark to communicate with the sniffer device</strong>

    Now if you use command to run the batch file again, you will get a messae "No arguments given!" meaning that you followed correctly the instructions:

    ```bash
    nrf_sniffer_ble.bat
    ```

11. Open WireShark and go to "Help" and then "About Wireshark". After that, go to the "Folders" tab. then, find the extcap path just as it is pointed in the red arrow and double-click that path. After double-clicking it will say "Should the directory be created?" and click yes. The directory created will open up after clicking yes, stay in that folder.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Omntk1J.gif" alt="MLH-banner" width="50%" height="50%">

12. Now, put on one side the extcap folder that was inside the folder we extracted from the downloaded zip and put it on the left side of your screen. On the right side of your screen, put the folder that was created after selecting yes.

<strong>It should look like this:</strong>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/91knVhX.png" alt="MLH-banner" width="50%" height="50%">

After that, copy everything from the extcap folder of the left-side to the extcap folder of the right side, it should look like this:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/q4o3iAl.png" alt="MLH-banner" width="50%" height="50%">

<strong>Now close everything and Reboot your Computer ðŸ«¡ðŸ‘»</strong>

Now If you start Wireshark, you will see that our interface for BLE will display and now we can double click on the BLE interface in order to start sniffing Bluetooth devices around us.

# Python - BLE Packet filtering logic

Our script improves BLE security assessments on Windows by implementing a specialized tshark filter to ignore BLE advertising packets. This refinement allows security analysts to concentrate on the more significant packets for penetration testing.

The rationale behind our filtering approach is to create a tshark display filter that negates conditions which match the common PDU types indicative of BLE advertising (ADV_IND, ADV_NONCONN_IND, ADV_SCAN_IND, etc.). By excluding packets with these PDU types, the filter simplifies packet analysis, enabling a more focused examination of BLE traffic that could be pertinent for security analyses.

The constructed filter syntax for tshark is as follows:

```bash
    "!(btle.advertising_header.pdu_type == 0x00 || btle.advertising_header.pdu_type == 0x02 || btle.advertising_header.pdu_type == 0x04 || btle.advertising_header.pdu_type == 0x06)"
```

This command, when used with tshark, will display all BLE packets except those with the specified PDU types, essentially omitting the common advertising packets. It enhances efficiency by limiting the volume of traffic to analyze and enabling analysts to focus on potentially vulnerable packets.

By including this filter in our Python script, we offer users a streamlined experience for BLE packet analysis on Windows platforms, leveraging Bettercap's capabilities with the precision of tshark's filtering features. This makes it a valuable contribution to the community, enhancing the effectiveness of security professionals' workflow when working with BLE devices.
